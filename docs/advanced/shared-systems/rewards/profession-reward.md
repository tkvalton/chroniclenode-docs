### bool unapply_from_player( player: Player, tracking_data: Dictionary ) {#method-unapply-from-player}

### bool supports_unapply() {#method-supports-unapply}

Returns true if this reward type can be removed/undone Override to return true for reversible rewards Default is false for safety - rewards must explicitly opt-in to removal *(from [Reward](/advanced/shared-systems/rewards/reward))*

### String get_summary() {#method-get-summary}
